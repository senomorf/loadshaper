## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-15

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES - CRITICAL FIX
- **Persistent volume storage now REQUIRED** - Docker Compose deployments must include persistent volume or container will not start
- **Container now runs as non-root user** (uid/gid 1000) for security
- **No fallback to ephemeral storage** - LoadShaper requires persistent storage for Oracle compliance
- **Network generation completely rewritten** - No backwards compatibility with previous network implementation ([#75](https://github.com/senomorf/loadshaper/issues/75))
- **Default NET_PEERS changed** - From placeholder IPs (10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3) to public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, 9.9.9.9)
- **Network configuration variables** - Several new variables added for reliability and validation

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Added persistent volume storage for metrics database in Docker Compose ([#74](https://github.com/senomorf/loadshaper/issues/74))
- **Metrics database persistence**: 7-day P95 history now preserved across container restarts
- **Oracle compliance**: P95 calculations maintain complete history required for reclamation detection
- **Container security**: Application now runs as non-root user (loadshaper:1000)
- **CRITICAL**: Network generation reliability completely fixed ([#75](https://github.com/senomorf/loadshaper/issues/75))
- **Silent network failures**: Now detects failed network generation via tx_bytes monitoring
- **Unreachable default peers**: Changed from RFC2544 placeholder IPs to public DNS servers
- **E2 external traffic requirement**: Validates external addresses and ensures Oracle-compliant external traffic
- **Network fallback chain**: Automatic fallback UDP → TCP → next peer → DNS servers → local generation

### Added
- **Entrypoint validation**: Container fails fast if persistent storage not properly mounted
- **Health endpoint enhancement**: Added `persistence_storage` status and `database_path` fields
- **Clear error messages**: Detailed guidance when persistent volume configuration is missing
- **NetworkGenerator state machine**: Complete state-driven network generation (OFF → INITIALIZING → VALIDATING → ACTIVE_UDP → ACTIVE_TCP → DEGRADED_LOCAL → ERROR)
- **Peer validation and reputation**: EMA-based scoring system tracks peer reliability over time
- **tx_bytes monitoring**: Runtime validation of actual network traffic generation via NIC statistics
- **External address validation**: Rejects RFC1918, loopback, and link-local addresses for E2 Oracle compliance
- **DNS packet generation**: EDNS0-padded DNS queries for reliable external traffic when UDP/TCP peers fail
- **Network health scoring**: 0-100 score based on state, peer reputation, validation success, and error rates
- **Automatic fallback chain**: UDP → TCP → next peer → DNS servers → local generation with hysteresis
- **Runtime peer switching**: Detects failed peers and automatically switches to healthy alternatives

### Changed

### Migration Required
Existing Docker Compose users must update their configuration:

```yaml
services:
  loadshaper:
    volumes:
      - loadshaper-metrics:/var/lib/loadshaper
      - ./config-templates:/app/config-templates:ro

volumes:
  loadshaper-metrics:
    driver: local
```

**Network Configuration (Breaking Change):**
- **NET_PEERS default changed**: Old placeholder IPs (10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3) now default to public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, 9.9.9.9)
- **New network variables**: Validation, fallback, and reliability settings added
- **Configuration templates**: All shape-specific templates updated with new defaults
- **No backwards compatibility**: Old network implementation completely removed

## [3.0.0] - P95 CPU Control Implementation (#73)

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES
- **New P95-driven CPU control system** - replaces previous implementation completely
