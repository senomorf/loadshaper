## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-15

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES
- **Persistent volume storage now REQUIRED** - Docker Compose deployments must include persistent volume or container will not start
- **Network generation completely rewritten** - No backwards compatibility with previous implementation
  - Default NET_PEERS changed from placeholder IPs (10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3) to public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, 9.9.9.9)
  - Several new network configuration variables added for reliability and validation
- **Container security hardened** - Now runs as non-root user (uid/gid 1000) with no fallback to ephemeral storage

### Fixed
- **Critical network generation bug fixes**:
  - **State machine initialization**: Fixed debounce blocking first transition from OFF‚ÜíINITIALIZING, preventing network generation startup
  - **CGNAT detection**: Fixed incomplete 100.64.0.0/10 range check (was only detecting 100.64.x.x, now properly detects entire 100.64.0.0-100.127.255.255)

  - **tx_bytes validation**: Fixed packet size mismatch in validation (now tracks actual bytes sent including DNS packet sizes)
  - **External egress verification**: Fixed false positives by checking actual peer used instead of any valid peer
- **Thread safety**: Ring buffer saves now use PID+thread temp files to prevent race conditions
- **Portable mount detection**: Replaced non-portable `stat -c %d` with Python-based device detection for Alpine/busybox compatibility

      - ./config-templates:/app/config-templates:ro

volumes:
  loadshaper-metrics:
    driver: local
```
