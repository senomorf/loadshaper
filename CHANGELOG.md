### Changed
- **Memory calculation**: Modernized to industry-standard using MemAvailable
  - Aligned with AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Oracle standards
  - Simplified telemetry display (changed from `mem(no-cache)` to `mem(excl-cache)`)
  - Memory occupation terminology clarified ("occupation" vs "stressing")
- **Network control**: Replaced continuous PID with adaptive start/stop mechanism
  - EMA-based current utilization tracking instead of incorrect 95th percentile
  - Resource efficiency improvements to minimize CPU and memory overhead
- **Default packet size**: Increased to 8900 bytes for jumbo frame environments
- **Configuration**: Enhanced templates with jumbo frame variants and better defaults
- **Documentation**: Restructured README.md with improved organization and Quick Start section
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures with exponential backoff

### Removed
- **iperf3 dependency**: Completely eliminated from codebase and Docker images
- **iperf3 service**: Removed from Docker Compose configuration
- **Legacy memory calculation**: Removed support for kernels without MemAvailable
- **DEBUG_MEM_METRICS**: Removed debug environment variable and dual metric display

### Fixed
- **Network fallback logic**: Corrected A1 shape logic (AND instead of OR for risk conditions)
- **Oracle criteria accuracy**: Fixed 95th percentile vs current utilization confusion
- **TCP buffer handling**: Fixed partial send issues in TCP mode
- **Token bucket dead zones**: Fixed issue where very low rates could prevent traffic generation
- **NET_PEERS validation**: Now accepts hostnames via DNS resolution fallback
- **TCP connection timeout**: Added 0.5s send timeout to prevent blocking
- **MTU validation**: Fixed large packet warnings and validation logic

### Breaking Changes
- **Linux 3.14+ required**: MemAvailable field dependency (older kernel support removed)
- **read_meminfo() signature**: Returns (total_bytes, used_pct, used_bytes) instead of 5-tuple
- **iperf3 removal**: External network server no longer supported
- **E2 configuration**: NET_TARGET_PCT raised from 15% to 25% to stay above Oracle's 20% threshold

### Technical Details
- Token bucket with 5ms ticks and elapsed-time based accumulation
- EMA smoothing for network utilization tracking with configurable alpha
- Signal handling for container orchestration compatibility
- Resource-aware fallback with minimum on/off periods to prevent oscillation
- New fallback control variables: NET_ACTIVATION, NET_FALLBACK_START_PCT, NET_FALLBACK_STOP_PCT
- Enhanced error handling prevents dead zones in rate limiting algorithm

### Security
- **Health endpoints security hardening**: Sanitized error messages, configurable host binding, HTTP method restrictions

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **7-day metrics storage**: SQLite database for rolling 7-day analysis
- **95th percentile calculations**: Mirrors Oracle's exact CPU reclamation criteria

- **Telemetry enhancement**: Shows current, 5-minute average, and 95th percentile values

### Changed
- **Improved CPU responsiveness**: Better yielding to legitimate workloads
- **Enhanced safety systems**: More intelligent load average detection

- Database size: 10-20MB for 7 days of data
- Default load thresholds: 0.6 (pause) / 0.4 (resume)

### Development History

This project evolved from a simple CPU stress tool into a comprehensive Oracle Cloud Always Free resource manager. Key milestones:

1. **CPU-only generation** (v1.0) - Basic prevention of CPU-based reclamation
2. **Multi-resource support** (v1.1) - Added memory and network components  
3. **Oracle-compliant monitoring** (v1.2) - 7-day 95th percentile tracking
4. **Production-ready** (current) - Comprehensive documentation and testing
