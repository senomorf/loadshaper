## Quick Start for Contributors

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senomorf/loadshaper.git
   cd loadshaper
   ```

2. **Set up Python virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Required: use venv for Python/pip commands
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

3. **Test the setup:**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   python -m pytest -q
   
   # Test Docker build
   docker compose build
   
   # Test runtime (requires Linux)
   python3 -u loadshaper.py  # or use Docker
   ```

- Platform-specific tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge case coverage

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Formatting**: PEP 8 style, 4-space indentation
- **Dependencies**: Keep minimal (stdlib only)
- **Names**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- **Priority**: All CPU work must use `os.nice(19)` for lowest priority

### Testing Requirements

**Before submitting any PR:**

1. **Unit tests must pass:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest -q
   ```

2. **Manual testing:**
   ```bash
   # Test basic functionality
   docker compose up -d --build
   docker logs -f loadshaper

   # Look for telemetry output showing metrics
   # Verify CPU/memory/network targets are being reached

   # Test network generator specifically
   # Check for network traffic in telemetry logs
   # Verify adaptive fallback behavior with NET_ACTIVATION=adaptive

   # Test different protocols
   NET_PROTOCOL=tcp docker compose up -d --build
   NET_PROTOCOL=udp docker compose up -d --build

   # Test custom targets (optional)
   NET_PEERS=8.8.8.8:53 NET_PROTOCOL=udp docker compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **Safety verification:**
   ```bash
   # Test that load workers pause under system stress
   LOAD_THRESHOLD=0.1 docker compose up -d
   # Verify workers pause quickly
   
   # Test responsiveness
   time ls -la /usr/bin/  # Should be <100ms
   ```

## Contribution Process

### 1. Planning
- **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
- **Open an issue** for discussion of major changes
- **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch

### 2. Implementation
- **Follow code style** guidelines above
- **Add tests** for new functionality
- **Update documentation** for user-facing changes
- **Keep changes focused** - one feature/fix per PR

### 3. Testing
- **Run all tests** locally before pushing
- **Test on actual Oracle Cloud** instances when possible
- **Verify both E2.1.Micro and A1.Flex** compatibility
- **Document any manual testing steps**

### 4. Submission
- **Create descriptive PR** with:
  - Clear summary of changes
  - Rationale for the change
  - Any new environment variables
  - Manual testing steps performed
  - Before/after telemetry logs

### 5. Review Process
- **Address feedback** promptly and thoughtfully
- **Keep PR updated** with latest main branch
- **Be patient** - thorough review ensures quality
